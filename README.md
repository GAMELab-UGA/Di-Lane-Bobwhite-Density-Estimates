# Di-Lane-Bobwhite-Density-Estimates
Distance sampling and spatial capture-recapture for estimating density of Northern Bobwhite.

R and JAGS code to fit hierarchical distance sampling and spatial capture recapture models to estimate Northern Bobwhite density at Di-Lane Plantation Wildlife Management Area in Georgia, using simulated and empirical data collected using four methods: 1) human observer point counts, 2) acoustic recording units, 3) trapping and 4) trapping with telemetry data.

Repository includes
1) R and JAGS code to fit Bayesian hierarchical distance sampling models to point count data (simulated and empirical)
2) JAGS code to fit Bayesian hierarchical distance sampling models to ARU data (simulated and empirical)
3) R code to fit spatial capture recapture models to trapping and telemetry data (simulated and empirical)
