# Di-Lane-Bobwhite-Density-Estimates
Distance sampling and spatial capture-recapture for estimating density of Northern Bobwhite.
R and JAGS code to fit hierarchical distance sampling and spatial capture recapture models to estimate Northern Bobwhite density at Di-Lane using simulated and empirical data collected using four methods: 1) human observer point counts, 2) acoustic recording units, 3) trapping and 4) trapping with telemetry data.
